/* Q:12 Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing
 each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/



let names: string[] = ["Faizan", "Khan", "Ali", "Zeeshan"];

 console.log(`Hello my brother, ${names[0]}`);
 console.log(`Hello my brother, ${names[1]}`);
 console.log(`Hello my brother, ${names[2]}`);
 console.log(`Hello my brother, ${names[3]}`);
